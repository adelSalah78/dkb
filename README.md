# <div style="text-align:center">Welcome to my solution :)</div>
# Prerequisties to run my solution:-
 1- Docker must be installed.<br>
 2- Java 11 must be installed if you need to rebuild application (actually no need to rebuild as I have uploaded the jar itself)
#
# How to run my solution:-
 1- Just navigate to the repo root folder in command line and run "docker-compose up -d"<br>
 2- This will run the docker-compose.yaml file specifcation and will create the database and start the jar after making sure that the database service is healthy
#
# P.S : Please refer to "Api documentation.txt" file in the root folder of the repo to test the required APIs.
# P.S : I wish I could find the time to make unit tests for the service layer to ensure that everything is okay but I have exceeded the time limit you have proposed for this task
# I have finished the task in almost 5 hours
# Also I wish I could find the time to automate everything from the build till the deploy with batch/shell scripts.

# Thank you so much, looking forward to meeting you :)
